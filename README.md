🔹 Project Objective

The objective of this project was to analyze Hospital Emergency Room (ER) data and create an interactive monthly dashboard that helps hospital management monitor patient flow, wait times, admission status, department referrals, and overall patient satisfaction. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.

🔹 Data Collection & Cleaning
Worked with raw hospital ER data containing patient details, visit dates, gender, age, department referrals, admission status, wait time, and satisfaction scores.
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel:
Removed duplicate patient records
Handled missing and null values
Corrected inconsistent department names and categories
Standardized date formats for monthly and yearly analysis
Validated numeric fields such as wait time and satisfaction score
This ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and analysis-ready.

🔹 Data Modeling & KPI Creation
Created key performance indicators (KPIs) to track:
Total number of patients
Average wait time
Patient satisfaction score
Percentage of patients attended within time
Used Excel formulas and Pivot Tables to calculate and summarize these metrics efficiently.

🔹 Pivot Tables & Slicers Implementation
Built multiple Pivot Tables to analyze:
Admission status (Admitted vs Not Admitted)
Patient distribution by age group
Gender-wise patient count
Department-wise patient referrals
Implemented Slicers for:
Month selection (Jan–Dec)
Year selection (2023, 2024)
These slicers allow users to dynamically filter the entire dashboard and view real-time insights for specific time periods.

🔹 Dashboard Design & Visualizations
Designed a clean and interactive dashboard using:
📊 KPI Cards – Total patients, average wait time, satisfaction score
📈 Area/Sparkline Charts – Monthly trends
🥧 Pie Chart – Patients attended within time
🍩 Doughnut Chart – Gender-wise patient distribution
📊 Column Chart – Patients by age group
📉 Horizontal Bar Chart – Department-wise patient referrals
📋 Summary Table – Admission status with percentage distribution
The layout was structured for quick readability, ensuring key insights are visible at a glance.

🔹 Key Insights Generated
Identified peak patient age groups visiting the ER
Analyzed admission vs non-admission ratios
Monitored patient wait times and service efficiency
Evaluated department referral patterns
Tracked patient satisfaction trends across months and years
